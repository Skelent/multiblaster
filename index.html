        Click and drag your mouse on the visible portion of the game to look around.
        Left click on a block to break it, and right click on a block face to place a block next to it (like in Minecraft).
        Click on a block icon to switch to placing it. Move around the world with WASD.
        If you can't move, try clicking the visible portion of the game.
        Clicking on the three vertical bars on the top-left corner of the screen opens a menu which will allow you to load and save worlds.

        Note: I did not completely make this.
        Full credit for creating the original version of this goes to <a href="https://github.com/Overv">Overv</a> on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
        I have simply modified it in order to add many features which make the game better, and more usable.
        You can find the original project <a href="https://github.com/Overv/WebCraft">here</a>, if you're interested.
